# Project Proposal
### Roy Portas

## What

The topic for my project is QLD Police crime data, specifically geolocation
data over time. It is envisioned that the crime data can be analysed to find
correlations over time, type of the crime and the location of the crime.

Additionally this can be combined with data containing Neighbourhood Watch
Areas and Police Beat locations.

## Why

The crime data is specific to Queensland and the Brisbane area, thus its
spatially relevant. 

## How

I will be using Matlab with Webmaps to visualize the geolocation data and
plotting quantitative data.
